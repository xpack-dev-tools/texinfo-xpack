The main target of this project is macOS 10.13, as the older version of
this utility fails during some builds.

[GNU texinfo](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/) is the official documentation format of the GNU project.

**GNU texinfo** is an open source project hosted on
[Savannah](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/texinfo/).

:::danger

Unfortunately this project uses perl, which installs
scripts with absolute paths.

Adjusting these paths to the actual install location
requires post processing after install,
a feature not yet available, therefore this project
is not yet functional.
